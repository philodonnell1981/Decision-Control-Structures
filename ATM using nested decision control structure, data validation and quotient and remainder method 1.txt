    * Inside an automated teller machine (ATM) there are notes
    * of $ 10, $ 5, and $ 1. 
    * Write a Java program to emulate the way this ATM works. 
    * At the beginning, the machine prompts the user to enter the four-digit PIN and then checks for PIN validity (assume “1234” as the valid PIN). 
    * If given PIN is correct, the program must prompt the user to enter the amount of money (an integer value) that he or she wants to withdraw 
    * and finally it displays the least number of notes the ATM must dispense. 
    * For example, if the user enters an amount of $ 36, the program must display “3 note( s) of $ 10, 1 note( s) of $ 5, and 1 note( s) of $ 1”. 
    * Moreover, if the user enters a wrong PIN, the machine will allow him or her two retries. 
    * If the user enters an incorrect PIN all three times, the message “PIN locked” must be displayed and the program must end. 
    * Assume that the user enters a valid value for the amount.

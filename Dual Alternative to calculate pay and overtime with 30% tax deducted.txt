     * he or she gets paid double for all hours worked over 40. 
     * Design a flowchart and write the corresponding Java program 
     * that lets the user enter the pay rate and hours worked and then 
     * calculates and displays net pay. 
     * Net pay is the amount of pay that is actually paid to the employee 
     * after any deductions. Deductions include taxes, health insurance, 
     * retirement plans, on so on. Assume a total deduction of 30% 
     * and that the user enters valid values.

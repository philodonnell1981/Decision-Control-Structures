    * In a toll gate, there is an automatic system that recognizes whether the

    * (M for motorcycle, C for car, and T for truck) and then displays the corresponding 
    * amount of money the driver must pay according to the following table. 
    * Vehicle Type    Amount to Pay 
    * Motorcycle      $ 1 Car 
    * Car             $ 2 
    * Truck           $ 4 
    * The program must function properly even when characters are given in lowercase. 
    * For example, the program must function properly either for “M” or “m”. 
    * However, if the user enters a character other than M, C, or T, an error message must be displayed.
